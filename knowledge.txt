WSGI - Web Server Gateway Interface

When you execute this command, pip will not only install Flask, but also all of its
dependencies. You can check what packages are installed in the virtual environment
at any time using the pip freeze command:


To start the hello.py application from the previous section, first make sure the virtual
environment you created earlier is activated and has Flask installed in it. For Linux
and macOS users, start the web server as follows:
(venv) $ export FLASK_APP=hello.py
(venv) $ flask run
* Serving Flask app "hello"
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
For Microsoft Windows users, the only difference is in how the FLASK_APP environ‚Äê
ment variable is set:
(venv) $ set FLASK_APP=hello.py
(venv) $ flask run
* Serving Flask app "hello"
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Once the server starts up, it goes into a loop that accepts requests and services them.
This loop continues until you stop the application by pressing Ctrl+C.


for DEBUG mode on our command should be

export FLASK_DEBUG=1

flask run
